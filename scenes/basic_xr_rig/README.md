# Basic XR Rig

The main scene here does not make use of the Godot-XR-Tools staging system, and
as such must be set manually as the Godot starting scene to test.

It contains a basic XR Rig manually constructed from an XROrigin3D, XRCamera3D,
and XRController3D nodes. It uses the XRAvatarDriverXrRig script to drive the
robot avatar.
